Doug’s theories on how inflation works for example applies directly to our condition today. It allows you to get a basic sense of how increases in costs translate to them being passed down to consumers, and how one can anticipate future increases due to lags in people catching up to inflation.\n\nI also like his theory of market barriers and how people switch between alternatives. It created insight for me on how certain career paths become insulated from over saturation because of the difficulty of getting in.\n\nThere were a lot of other theories which I really enjoyed. One of Doug’s most controversial theories is that no one does anything out of pure altruism, and I fought internally with this for a while. But when we can accept the truth that we also benefit when acting altruistic, we can be more genuine with our charity and act with greater clarity.\n\nI am not speaking to who Doug Allen is nor what his beliefs are. I am purely speaking about how his concepts have allowed me to better understand myself and the world we live in.",1712521881.0

I'm not sure if it's just the TA I got or the format of the course, but it's possibly the worst grading and material I've seen so far. I took ENGL 111 last semester and I thought it was complex enough for a first year course, but I expected that and I didn't feel as though it was unfair. \n\nThe ENGL 112 course is a hybrid online/in person tutorials and my TA is super unclear and honestly a tad rude. The books are significantly less complex than those of ENGL 111 (we read a monster calls and a comic book this semester while in 111 we were reading Beloved and The Satanic Verse) but the level of writing expected for the assignments is wildly different and more complex. The essay is expected to be 7+ pages but the only feedback I received from the TA on a draft I submitted was to condense my arguments. I feel as though this level or writing goes beyond the scope of a first year course, and the lectures consist of formatting for a 5 paragraph essay and thats it. How is a 5 paragraph essay supposed to meet the 7 page expectation? Especially when we are analyzing a book meant for middle schoolers? \n\nI also don't recommend this class for anyone looking to take it because you're basically paying for nothing. The professor links YouTube videos as ""lectures"" and pretty much calls it a day. How is this meant to be effective learning? \n\nAnyway I just wanted to know if anyone else had/is having similar experiences or if other people are having better luck with different TAs.

(Spring 2024),"I am usually not the type of person to complain about classes on reddit but I am having a hard time accepting the grading scheme for this ENGL 199W class. How the grading scheme works is that all the assignments are capped at 75% but there is a ""bonus assignment"" thats worth 20% (almost like a midterm..) but only those with a class grade of 75% or higher can ""apply"" to seek permission to actually do it. So hypothetically if someone were to miss one small quiz leading them to have a class grade less than 75%, that person would never have the chance to get a higher grade because they wouldn't be able to do the bonus assignment. As someone who missed a quiz, my grade is sitting at 73% deeming me ineligible for the bonus assignment and therefore the best I can do now is below a 75%. Am I wrong for thinking this is unfair? I believe that this grading scheme puts students at an extreme disadvantage because arbitrarily capping grades like that isn't giving my assignments what they're worth and then further barring students from doing the bonus assignment because they fail to meet a certain requirement is ridiculous.

He said either we can email him by Friday to ""fess up"" (and just receive a few marks off assignments) or he will schedule private meetings with us to prove we didn't use any AI on works he suspects we used it. He said if we can't provide adequate proof we didn't use AI he could give us an F or even FD. For reference, there are like 130 ish people in my class.\n\nI wasn't too worried about this but I'm starting to wonder on what basis is my professor going to accuse people of using AI? Can't any piece of work be accused of using *some* AI? Out of curiousity, I scanned one of my authentic works into the chat zero checker and it *still* said my work could be 6% AI. Out of all my works, 6% was the highest possible detection of AI I got.\n\nWhat's even worse is the google doc I used to write all my assignments out on (then copy/paste into the Canvas textbox submission thingy) is permanently deleted- we wrote our last assignment for the course a while ago and this is an elective outside of my arts major so I just thought I'd never use the doc again. My google drive storage is also 12.49/15 GB used up so I try to delete stuff whenever I can, but in a way I've kinda just (permanently) destroyed my proof. I only have one other separate doc that actually shows my writing process for one assignment I did in this course.\n\nMy question is, should I worry at all? Would he only accuse people who have a super high AI detection in their writing? I would in no way cheat for this class- I mean, I'm an English major anyway so 250 words is nothing to me and all the class content was perfectly understandable. Heck, my prof basically spelled out how to answer the assignment prompt for us in lectures. I've never received this sort of message from a prof before and found it a bit scary and like a false accusation to everyone in the class, so I'm just not sure what to make of the situation.\n\n**TLDR;** prof suspected lots of people using ChatGPT throughout the course and is vigilant to find cases of this, I didn't use any AI but even one of *my* works has like 6% AI detected so who is he actually going to accuse + should I worry at all given I don't have super good evidence to prove I never used AI?

This summary is part of a larger resource document where we discuss various challenges faced by Indigenous populations. The interview summary below sheds light on the challenges of food scarcity faced by some First Nation territories and the significant effects of climate change on harvest patterns for First Nations communities.\n\nUnexpected harvesting patterns because of climate change have threatened many First Nation communities’ food, health, and land. These remote First Nation territories are observing the effects of climate change firsthand, but the government of Canada has been slow to take appropriate action to mitigate these changes.\n\nFirst Nation communities in Ontario, Yukon, and BC have felt the effects of climate change slightly differently. In BC, First Nation chiefs are monitoring salmon populations and refraining from catching when populations reach a certain number. However, this directly limits the availability of fresh foods for this remote community. When these remote communities are forced to rely on store-bought foods, they are most often shopping with a limited budget and are only able to afford plentiful of cheap, processed foods that have little to no nutritional value.\n\nIn the vast, remote land of Yukon, the warmer weather has made it dangerous to hunt and travel on ice. Many hunters had reported falling through the ice, making hunting traditional foods a risk. The residents of these remote areas are again relying on store-bought foods due to the trickling effects of climate change. The interview also highlighted that research found maintaining traditional diets was a protective factor against diabetes.\n\nWhile these First Nation communities observe a continuous disruption in lifestyle and food systems, they have also proven to be resilient and adapting. The government of Canada needs to work quickly in mitigating the effects of climate change, beginning with the effects of food accessibility in remote First Nation communities. Addressing climate change requires a global effort so that we can provide a sustainable planet for our future.\n\nWe believe that this topic is just the tip of an iceberg to a much larger problem. It cannot be ignored that studies have continuously observed higher rates of obesity and diabetes in First Nation populations, especially their children. Climate change affecting harvest patterns could be exasperating the higher rates of health disparities.\n\n**TL;DR:** Climate change is causing unpredictable harvests, endangering the food, health, and land of First Nation communities in Ontario, Yukon, and BC. The Canadian government has been slow to act. In BC, chiefs are monitoring salmon populations but limiting catches, leading to food shortages. In Yukon, warmer weather makes hunting dangerous, forcing reliance on processed foods. Traditional diets are protective against diabetes. Communities are resilient but need urgent government action to address food access. Climate change exacerbates health disparities among First Nations.\n\nInterview Reference: [https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/21/interview-climate-crisis-hurts-harvest-first-nations](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/10/21/interview-climate-crisis-hurts-harvest-first-nations)\n\nTo collect some data, please answer this poll: [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/R9LNDLH](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/R9LNDLH)\n\nIf you'd like to see our resource document, please see here: [Resource Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DSBaKagGKx6NBlx9dlhdUHb5ENZbWD0K1jmouJmFPYA/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nWe appreciate if you have read this far and hope that you were able to take away some valuable knowledge from our summary above.",1711312242.0

For example, intro courses in the arts have averages in the 80% range, whereas intro engineering courses have 60% averages. It wouldn’t make sense to give the majority of arts majors higher grades and GPA’s than Engineering students, and vice versa.\n\nCurved grading does two things. First, in difficult courses, it centers grading around the performance of the class. It is much more probable that a class with an average of 60% is just a hard class rather than composed of idiots. By grading on a curve, you are assigning grades based on reasonable expectations of what is achievable in that course.\n\nSecond, it adds consistency to grading across majors. To be an A student means that you are in the top 10% of your class in your major. Basically, GPA becomes quantifiable as a metric of how well you as a student perform in your classes based on reasonable expectations of the courses you take. You can’t “game” a higher GPA.",1711129719.0

To make matters worse, often times instructors will use programs such as TurnItIn or GPTZero to automatically “flag” major written assignments for AI usage. The issue is that they’re known to be inaccurate and trigger-happy. If the instructor hasn’t explicitly said you can use GenAI, and you have no proof that you wrote it from start to finish, you could be in big trouble. How can you prove that you wrote it?\n\n**One of the most effective solutions (for now): Version histories**. Most cloud storage services keep every version of a modified file. So if you’re on Word/Pages/LibreOffice, for example, every time you save, a new version is created and stored in the cloud. Most cloud services support version histories, including: **OneDrive, Google Drive, iCloud Drive (Only in iWork apps apparently), Nextcloud/ownCloud, Filen, and more**. Chances are that if you store your assignments in the cloud (which you should be imho), every version of the file that you’ve worked on will be there.\n\nWhen you’re falsely accused, pull up this version history and offer to send the instructor every version of the project. This would not be a bluff, you can actually do this. These version files are timestamped, but more importantly, they provide evidence of your creative process: Small blocks of writing, revisions, rephrasing, grammatical fixes, and more.\n\nNow that you know that you have this tool at your disposal, you’ll know what to do if an instructor gets a little too confident in their ability to spot GenAI.\n\nEdit: Typo",1711044820.0

Past changes in our ecosystems impact present day ecosystem function, health and structure, just as historical social decisions (like policies) have longstanding legacies. Cities, in particular, provide a unique opportunity to explore the intersection where humans and their constructed ecosystems co-exist.\n\nIt is in these environments that we can interrogate how our past shapes our social-ecological present. Hence, if we hope to build resilient cities for our future, it is imperative that we deconstruct how past societal processes have shaped our ecological present.\n\nIn his talk, Dr. Chris Schell will explore how one of those social legacies enshrining residential segregation and disinvestment in Black neighborhoods (i.e., redlining) continues to influence social and environmental features of cities today.\n\nDr. Schell will also demonstrate how modern inequities in environmental health and socioeconomics have tangible impacts from human behaviour to biodiversity.",1710819479.0

I think sfu is cracking down and sending their tickets to a collections company. He changed his plates but even then I think the collections company can see who had the plate at the time it got the tickets. Kinda dumb I think they trying to make up for the budget loss from TAs. I’ve heard of people also getting them from my lectures. Yesterday I just got the email and a letter. They add interest I had 3 tickets and got charged 225 which is more than what they are worth originally on the bill rip. I think they’re slowly doing it as there’s probably a lot of tickets. I checked online and it turns out private collections  companies can get info from icbc. Which is how they get people who change plates I’m guessing. I don’t think it’s a hard or long process either for them. If you have a lot of tickets I’d recommend you pay them since the interest might be wild if you get caught by them.

Very unfortunately, the University preempted our receiving that news at our executive meeting with Joy Johnson, Yabome Gilpin-Jackson and Martin Pochurko. Instead, earlier today, SFU sent out news of significant restructuring and news of a “volunteer departure program” without even giving us the courtesy of learning firsthand from the senior administration at tomorrow’s meeting.\n\nThe restructuring news at SFU is beyond terrible, and I’m sure that many of you are very upset, afraid and even outraged. Unfortunately, at the time of writing, the University has told us a little more than it has you, and we’re not yet able to answer your many questions.\n\nAs soon as we know more, we’ll alert you.\n\nRegardless, we strongly disagree with Dilson Rassier’s platitude-filled email that this restructuring and the job loss it entails will be “part of an opportunity for change.” Sorrow, anger and grief are more apt for such an awful announcement. It won’t be the senior administration suffering job loss.\n\nAgain, we’re very sorry that the University has chosen to act in the offensive way it has regarding its working relationship with us and, most importantly — you.\n\nPlease do contact us if you require our help with this or anything else. We’re here for you always",1709765510.0

TLDR: hiring freeze extended, admin job losses expected. \n\n———\n\nThis message has been sent on behalf of Dilson Rassier, provost and chief budget officer, to all faculty and staff. A similar message will be sent to all 2024 spring term students.\n  \nHello everyone,\n  \nAs promised in the faculty and staff town hall in January, I am writing to provide an update on the current budget situation as we prepare to close out the fiscal year.\n  \nSFU is one of Canada’s leading research universities, and is dedicated to supporting students in their learning journey and scholars with their research and teaching. SFU has a plan to continue growing, providing the best programs for our students and contributing significantly to academic research and knowledge. However, along with other prominent universities in Canada, SFU is facing budget challenges. Based on our latest forecasts, the university is estimating an annual deficit totaling $20.9 million for the 2023/24 fiscal year, with that number rising to an estimated $49.9 million during the 24/25 fiscal year.\n  \nWe have many budget pressures. Declining international student enrollment has had an impact on our financial situation, and overall costs have increased at a higher rate than our revenues and funding.\n  \nThe executive team’s highest priority is to find ways to address this shortfall. The university is taking steps to reduce expenses and to find new approaches to strengthen our revenue streams.  \n  \nOur actions to-date have made a positive impact, and I thank you for your efforts and suggestions over these last several months. Further action to address our budget pressures is needed.\n  \nIn order to step into our full potential, while also addressing our budget challenges and establishing a sustainable model, we must make changes to our organizational operations. For an organization as strong and with as much potential as SFU, we see this moment as part of an opportunity for change. \n  \nThe university has made the decision to restructure certain areas of its operations with an aim to increase efficiency and reduce duplication. As part of this work, we will also review service levels and identify work that is no longer required. During this restructuring, some administrative job losses can be expected. We are also extending the hiring freeze into the 24/25 fiscal year.\n  \nWe are working hard and doing all we can to support employees through this process with care and compassion while upholding our commitments to equity. We are committed to working with unions and employee groups to craft adjustment plans that consider such options as a voluntary separation program, as well as ensuring appropriate packages and supports. More information will be available in the coming weeks. \n  \nWe will do all we can to support people who will be impacted by these changes, however, we acknowledge how difficult this will be. We also recognize that this news may create questions or uncertainty within our community. We are committed to providing more information as soon as we are able to share it.\n  \nSFU has always been led by our values, and we will continue to make decisions from that place. We want to ensure affordability for students as we navigate this challenging time. Our plans will minimize any impact on teaching, learning and research. We have also made commitments to adhere to our values, such as becoming a living wage employer and extending more supports to graduate students, and we will honour those commitments.\n \nWe want to remind you that many forms of support are available. In addition to the well-being webpage where you can access mental health and wellness supports, we encourage you to have a conversation with your supervisor or dean about this news and what this means for your team. \n  \nThe next few months will be difficult for the university, but we are confident that SFU will be stronger as we move forward. \n  \nSincerely,\n  \nDilson Rassier\nProvost and Chief Budget Officer\nSimon Fraser University",1709752748.0

He's trying super hard to rep up the CGs, including his CG, DNA.\n\nWhat he doesn't tell you is how he was involved in stealing funds from Accessibility Committee to fund an external event that had nothing to do with the SFU community. \n\nOn Feb 9th, 2023 a motion was brought forward at Accessibility Committee. \n\nIt stated:\n\n""Accessibility Grant for project ""Creating the Futures We Dream Of""- MOTION AC 2023-02- 09:05\n\nWhereas, the event showcase the vital community work and engage the wider community in discussion about collective survival and liberation; Whereas, the event is about mutual aid and community care featuring disabled and QTBIPOC speakers and artists, with proceeds going to Masks4EastVan, a mutual aid project; Be it resolved to approve a $3510 accessibility grant for project ""Creating the Futures We Dream Of: Reflections on Mutual Aid, Community Care & Collective Liberation"".""\n\nSo essentially, over a third of Accessibilty comittees funding for that year was pilfered by DNA to run an external event that has no benefit to the SFU community. What is worse is that all of the proceeds from this event went to a charity run by the DNA member who brought it forward. \n\nWho voted yes on this motion? Our good friend who has been very vocal on this subreddit lately, Joel Gilani. Despite DNA getting over $100,000 a year from the SFSS in funding, again like SOCA, for a very small number of students, Joel seems to think that taking money that is meant to help students with accessibility needs navigate student life is okay. \n\nAccessibility Committee is meant to fund things like closed captioning for deaf students, interpreters and the like, not fund external events for DNA members to steal the proceeds from for their own charities.\n\n[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/masks-4-east-van-1.6529653](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/masks-4-east-van-1.6529653)\n\nYou can see the conflict of interest with the funding from this story, as the same person who brought the funding request forward is the person running the charity. To this day, I do not know what happened to the proceeds from this event. The money is essentially gone. \n\nThe problems with DNA are the same as I alluded to earlier with SOCA. There is no transparency with regards to how they spend their money, and they seem content to pull funds meant for marginalized students outside their organization for whatever they want whenever they please. Further, they are also a small group of students that gets a disproportionately large amount of funding. \n\nWhat is worse is how exclusionary they are. You can read here:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1crCsRA1GpLvdQMFgZytUH6uk5cy7TC3KAr9cSsyL8gc/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1crCsRA1GpLvdQMFgZytUH6uk5cy7TC3KAr9cSsyL8gc/edit)\n\nThey essentially make you agree with all these activist points of view, or you cannot join. So, if you think differently, you cannot join.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScMfwICYkJF21PWdD2YC9fcGO5O-Ux38W5jVXJkDwgpp-8QJg/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScMfwICYkJF21PWdD2YC9fcGO5O-Ux38W5jVXJkDwgpp-8QJg/viewform)\n\nYou also must give your full name and SFU email when joining. In my experience, no other DSU or student group asks for your private information like DNA does. \n\nFailing to agree/give up your information means you cannot join. \n\nNow, back to Joel.\n\nu/joelgilani\n\nCan you answer some questions?\n\nWhy did you feel the need to fund an external event that has no benefit to the SFU community with funds that are meant for marginalized students on campus?\n\nTo quote you:\n\n""And individual's activism interest? I fought for the accommodations that I'm legally entitled to because SFU is a massive bureaucratic nightmare that makes life hell for every single student. I wouldn't have had that if DNA didn't exist. Even now people who need the space have this entrenched ableism for refusing resources that there's someone else who needs it more. That's all DNA does, we're a ragtag group of burnt out kids that are banded together because we've fallen through the cracks for so long.""\n\nWhy do you in one breath state your difficulty in getting your supports, but then through your actions take funding for supports away from other students in need?\n\nTo quote you:\n\n""I'm the treasurer for DNA, I see every invoice, every cheq req, and every meeting minute where something was approved. It felt more like a personal attack when OP said there's no oversight within CGs. I understand there might have been isolated incidents where things went wrong but the broad generalizations just irked me. Even if the point being made was valid the intentions just felt wrong.""\n\nAs treasurer, what does DNA do with all their money? Why does DNA have a habit of always asking for more money when they get over $100,000/yr? \n\nHow can we trust you to run the VP External budget if you cannot even run DNA's budget so they are not spending more than they get in funding?\n\nHow can we know based on your past actions that you will not show favoritism to your DNA friends as you have in the past if you get elected?\n\nTo everyone else, why is electing an activist VP external, not a good idea?\n\nEndless trips on your dollar:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/simonfraser/comments/10lkc6o/no\\_sfss\\_execs\\_we\\_do\\_not\\_want\\_to\\_pay\\_for\\_your\\_trip/](https://www.reddit.com/r/simonfraser/comments/10lkc6o/no_sfss_execs_we_do_not_want_to_pay_for_your_trip/)\n\nNever mind all the infighting. \n\nAnd per the link above, only funding items for their in groups.\n\nI will not be voting for Joel Gilani tomorrow.

He is the current SOCA vice president, the RHA (Residence Hall Association) president and a councillor on the SFSS council. He is running for president of the SFSS next year.\n\nMy concerns stem from the fact that in his campaign materials, he promotes building even stronger relations with the constituency groups (CGs). These would be SOCA, DNA and FNMISA, which are already so entrenched in policy that no meaningful changes can be made to counter the huge amount of resources and lack of oversight these groups have.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/simonfraser/comments/1aecrb9/a\\_view\\_of\\_the\\_sfss\\_from\\_a\\_former\\_councilor/](https://www.reddit.com/r/simonfraser/comments/1aecrb9/a_view_of_the_sfss_from_a_former_councilor/)\n\nRecently, the SFSS council passed a motion that any changes to policy that interact with the CGs would have to be approved by them. This means that the SFSS is now actively funding the CGs but has no power to make any changes to them. The rampant corruption and misuse of hundreds of thousands of dollars yearly can continue to go unchecked. The SFSS is essentially powerless to stop this.\n\nSOCA, where Emmanuel is Vice-president, receives over 100,000 dollars from the fee money the SFSS collects every year for such a small student group. They have roughly 500 members, according to what Emmanuel has stated previously.\n\nTo put that in perspective, all of the other Departmental Student Unions (DSUs) put together do not get much more than that despite representing many more students.\n\nDespite this generous funding, SOCA always has its hands out, asking for more money. SOCA wanted 10,000 dollars to send 28 students to a 'wellness retreat' at a resort in Chilliwack. At the May 24th council meeting, Emmanuel stated it was not a big deal as larger events had been approved.\n\nTo quote him from the meeting minutes on May 24th, 2023:\n\n""The RHA Councillor mentioned that CG's do not have a grant item. This money is not a big amount as it has been passed before for other events as well. The down payment is already deposited and if we do not support the SOCA, the down payment will be wasted.""\n\nHe also neglected to state that he had already received $5,000 from the BIPOC committee last year, a committee that is supposed to fund events and other things for marginalized students within the SFU community. SOCA swallowed up half of the money that the BIPOC committee had for the entire year. This took away funding from other events so they could pay for their party in Chilliwack and put the money down before letting Council know to try to pressure Council into agreeing with their funding motion.\n\nThe motion was postponed until June 21st; when it came to Council again. This time, SOCA mysteriously 'only' wanted $5,875 instead of the $10,000 they had wanted previously. By then, Council had caught on to SOCA pilfering half of BIPOC committee's money under Emmanuel's leadership.\n\n""VP Events stated that regardless of the price, operations for this started before the grant process was approved or executed. Half of the funds were secured through BIPOC however this means that other groups within BIPOC will have to work around only half of their funding for the rest of the year. The request for 10k came before the proper audit of what SFSS would be liable for. It is important that Councilors take it to their Constituency groups through the correct process for grants. There needs to be fiscal responsibility for these decisions within leadership, especially considering the deficit SFSS carried out last year. A proper review of the books needs to be had before a request for a large amount of money is put forward. No one from SFSS or SOCA tried to stop this irreversible use of these funds. This happened under a set of leaders and there needs to be responsibility taken. ""\n\nEmmanuel had nothing to say to that, noting that there were 'unforeseen costs.' In the end, Council struck down the motion and did not fund it.\n\nSo, what happened to the $5,000? Well, it turns out SOCA had their little party anyway and never needed the money from Council in the first place. The blatant dishonestly coming from SOCA regarding funding this event is not acceptable to me as a fee-paying student.\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/p/CusL2EeuJXC/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CusL2EeuJXC/)\n\nYou can see their party at the resort here, where they brought in expensive speakers and food.\n\nIn essence, if Emmanuel cannot be trusted to tell the truth about his own Constituency Group, how can he be trusted to run the SFSS?\n\nIn the meantime, if you are a BIPOC student wondering why there is no funding for your club/events, thank SOCA and Emmanuel for that.\n\nSOCA is incredibly self-serving and has a history of creating policies and programs that, on the surface, supposedly support marginalized communities. But under that thin veneer of purportedly helping students who historically have not had those opportunities, they instead push things that cost tons of money from student fees and only benefit them.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/simonfraser/comments/105dnd4/10000\\_award\\_for\\_black\\_students\\_exclusionary/](https://www.reddit.com/r/simonfraser/comments/105dnd4/10000_award_for_black_students_exclusionary/)\n\nSOCA has a $10,000 service award for black students, but if you look at the requirements, it gives preference to SOCA members. So, instead of helping all marginalized students on campus, they only did it to help themselves and their friends. Look at the comments on the above thread and how they attack other people.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/simonfraser/comments/soo4ik/call\\_to\\_action\\_investigate\\_the\\_sfss/](https://www.reddit.com/r/simonfraser/comments/soo4ik/call_to_action_investigate_the_sfss/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/simonfraser/comments/wr6dmz/comment/il0jilr/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/simonfraser/comments/wr6dmz/comment/il0jilr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nSOCA ran a referendum to create a fund that we all pay into with fees. They were supposed to use this money to fund a significant number of activities and scholarships. However, what resulted from the money from this fund, with the previous SFSS executives who were also coincidentally SOCA members, was that the SFSS (and your fees by extension) was made to pay for it.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/simonfraser/comments/wsvln9/im\\_done\\_with\\_soca\\_and\\_balqees\\_the\\_progressives/](https://www.reddit.com/r/simonfraser/comments/wsvln9/im_done_with_soca_and_balqees_the_progressives/)\n\nCurrently, as I have said, there is very little oversight to what SOCA does. The last two years of nonsense have been under Emmanuel's leadership as vice president. Many of the questionable decisions come down to him.\n\nWhen former VP external and SOCA member Eshana Baran wanted to fund 'volunteers' to the tune of $20,000 last year through the MSU (migrants student union), Emmanuel spoke in favour of it. When Eshana decided to censure three council members for speaking out about it, Emmanuel once again supported it. Only because of the bravery of three members of Council, did another external group full of self-serving SOCA members not get funding and space in the SUB.\n\nThe MSU proposal was struck down at the first meeting this year. Despite all the emergency meetings, Eshana Baran, with Emmanuel's support, did not manage to pass that motion at the April 24th meeting.\n\nSo what happens if you bring up any of these issues at Council?\n\nYou get called racial epithets:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/YZOfDgF](https://imgur.com/a/YZOfDgF)\n\nYou get bullied and harassed like Liam did earlier this year or like many others who stepped down last year. Emmanuel has not spoken out to condemn any of the bad behaviour of his SOCA members. Not once.\n\nFrom the SFSS point of view, next year is important. You all remember the TSSU strike and how terrible that was? Well, the SFSS and their staff have negotiations coming up later this year. The SFSS had a million-dollar deficit last year, so I do not know how they will be able to pay the hard-working staff a fair wage. With lower student enrollment, services will have to be cut.\n\nSo, if you want a possible strike because Emmanuel is giving more money to SOCA and the CGs, please vote for him.\n\nIf you want to support those same people who shut down the SUB during COVID and have gutted the SFSS from top to bottom over the last five years, vote for Emmanuel.\n\nIf you want someone who has a history of pillaging student fees and blatant fiscal dishonesty for his own benefit, vote for Emmanuel.\n\nIf you want someone who has stood back and allowed SOCA members on numerous occasions to bully and harass multiple people, vote for Emmanuel.\n\nIf you want better than that, read the candidate list here:\n\n[https://sfss.ca/get-involved/candidate-platforms-2024/](https://sfss.ca/get-involved/candidate-platforms-2024/)\n\nand vote for literally anybody else.\n\nThe people backing Emmanuel are small in number but highly motivated. I challenge you, SFU students, to vote tomorrow and elect anybody else. Do not let the on-campus activists continue to enrich themselves at your expense over and over.",1708853613.0

Turns out that this place is infamous for going out of their way to deflate GPAs, making it one of the toughest grading universities in Canada and the United States.\n\n""Well what if you guys are just idiots?"". Fair question lol. Let me explain.\n\nThis university mirrors their course content from MIT. According to one of the (medical) doctors on campus, more than 30% of the students are ""diagnosed"" with ADD (they shouldn't have access to these scripts, but are forced to in order to complete). Tldr: more than 1/3rd of the student body is on crack.\n\nThe average admitted grades (from high school) are 85%+ for domestic applicants and 95%+ for international students, which make up >30% of the student body. For context, my 90 average fell in the lower third of my program.\n\nI switched out 3rd year, after a friend from an IVY LEAGUE looked through my coursework and was shocked by both the complexity and magnitude (same major, same timeframe) of the content. Apparently my calc class assigned ~3x more material per week in comparison to hers.\n\nThe ptsd from that school was very real. I studied more than I ever had in my life in those three years and yet my grades still tanked. The anxiety and misery everyone has on that campus is difficult to convey in words.\n\nin contrast the following university I attended felt like a complete 180. The professors actually cared to create appropriate course content. People on campus didn't look like they wanted to cry or kill themselves.

I'm an international student and about 90% done with the process of enrolling in the UTPS2 program for business administration in FIC for this fall. I received a conditional offer letter with a gpa requirement to transfer into SFU following the first year. I've read a lot of conflicting takes on FIC with it being a scam and not worth the money however I believe it's the best destination for me.   \n\n\nQuestions regarding FIC:  \n\n\n1) Are there genuine concerns to be had with the transfer process from fic to sfu? I've seen people complain about teachers trying to hold students back or hidden requirements with transferring and I would love for anyone to ease my tensions with potential problems with this process.  \n\n\n2) How difficult is it going to be to maintain the required GPA? I'd say I'm a relatively good student but the required GPA for business students is higher than the other programs.   \n\n\n3) What will my options be if I do fall short of the required GPA? I've seen people talk about repeat courses or supplementary applications. I've also heard some people manage to transfer without the required GPA, so would love some more info on this.  \n\n\n4) Are there any restrictions with regards to facilities or student lifestyle that fic students face that sfu students don't? I plan to live on res and would love to partake in clubs, athletics and more without facing problems as an fic student.  \n\n\n5) How active are students in regards to clubs and mainly recreational sports in different skill levels? I've seen clubs and schedules but it's impossible to know what the environment is unless you're there. I'm mostly interested in football(soccer), tennis and table tennis but I'm willing to play almost anything.  \n\n\n6) With regards to housing all the options and decisions are a tad overwhelming so would love some input on which ones worked out best for you. It seems the towers are best for first years and I was mainly leaning on the east/west towers. I've also seen the tours of the single rooms in all the towers but can't find footage or information of super singles and single w/bathrooms  \n\n\n7) I would love to hear general opinions on classes as an fic student. I've heard there are 4 hour classes but it seems to be more comfortable as the classes have fewer students.  \n\n\nI feel as though fic is most suited for me because it seems it will be the easiest and most comfortable to adapt to the newer environment as an international student, I also have a strong appreciation for the location and facilities that sfu students so get so that was definitely my favored choice.

Both Dr. Gordon and my TA confirmed this in the first week of classes. So far, I have attended all lectures but have only attended 2/4 labs. In one of those missed labs, we were supposedly placed into groups, and because I didn't attend, the TA didn't add me to any group (which at this point, I had no idea). There was nothing on the syllabus indicating when we would be placed in groups, nothing on canvas indicating that groups were already made and no emails. Seeing as labs were ""not mandatory"", I didn't see any use of contacting my TA for my absences as I understood the lecture material. So the next week, I start working on an assignment which was a project outline, the instructions says that this part of the project would be completed and submitted individually while the other aspects of the project would be with our groups. So I assumed that groups would be formed later on in the semester as this was a semester long project. Looking back, maybe I should have contacted my TA at this point but I had no idea that groups were even made, absolutely no contact from my TA or anything to suggest that groups had been formed. A couple weeks go by and I get my grades back, a 0. The note basically says that I haven't attended any labs (even though I have) and have not been placed in any group, so the outline doesn't meet the criteria (even though the criteria doesn't say anything about groups) and it tells me to contact Dr. Gordon. I emailed her Friday afternoon and have yet to receive a response :( \n\nAm I in the wrong? I basically got a 0 because I didn't attend a lab that's ""not mandatory"" and was not told that groups were formed. \n\nAnd to do add to that, we have an assignment that was released a couple weeks ago, that is due on the 18th, but she hasn't even released the articles that we need to complete the assignment. \n\nSorry for the long post lol and any grammar mistakes.",1707680092.0

Follow this guide and never be interrupted by it again.\n\n\n## Step 1: Pick a Password Manager\nYour first options should be **Bitwarden** (no it’s not crypto-related), **1Password, or Proton Pass**. These are all paid, but they’re reputable providers who know what they’re doing. Bitwarden is the cheapest. You really shouldn’t use the manager that comes with your browser, but I’m not your dad.\n\nIf you don’t wanna pay and still wanna use the cloud, your only remaining options should be using **iCloud Keychain or Google Passwords**. If you don’t wanna use the cloud (technically better for security but not by much for this scenario), use 2FAS on iOS or Aegis on Android.\n\n\n## Step 2: Enter your TOTP Seed\nTOTP stands for Time-based One-Time Password, and the seed is what your device combines with the time to calculate the 6-digit code you type in. \n\nWhen you set up MFA with SFU, you have the option of scanning a QR code or entering the seed manually. You don’t need the QR - copy and paste the seed into your manager. On the first 3 managers it’s straightforward. On iOS this is in Settings > Passwords > (SFU Website). Not sure where it is on Android but I know you can access it on the Google Account settings page.\n\n\n## Step 3: Profit??\nNext time you autofill your account details, your 6-digit code will be filled in automatically. There. Now you can save a couple seconds.\n\n\nEdit: Folks, there seems to be some confusion on what the security benefit of storing the code on a separate app actually is. Someone said it protects your account on public wifi, but that’s not how it works. Connections to SFU’s authentication, like connections to basically any website in the past decade, is secured with TLS. You can look up what this is, but in one line it’s a method of asymmetric encryption that protects your connection (NOT the DNS requests) from prying eyes. Storing it in a separate app does absolutely nothing to change this, in fact it’s not even related since the seed isn’t entered in the sign-in form in the first place. In terms of *storage* security, the cloud-based methods I gave use client-side encryption to protect your seed. No one but you (or someone in your account) can access it.",1707452085.0

I was elected to the SFSS last year, and I ran because I wanted to try and make a positive change to the organization. I quickly realized that the SFSS is rotten to its core; there is little that can be done to fix it. I’m scared for the future of the student society—and all student life—at our school.\n\nNow, you might be asking: why should most regular students care about what goes on at the SFSS? Great question. I had the same thought before I joined the council and started understanding the inner workings.\n\nHere’s why: the SFSS has the ability to ***irreversibly*** fuck up the experience of present and future students, as well as destroying the reputation of our school. The SFSS is quickly becoming a totalitarian regime, controlled by a few glorified kids, with no real life experience and an annual budget of **3.2 million dollars** of your student fees ([2021-2022-Budget-Final-Budget.pdf (sfss.ca)](https://sfss.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2021-2022-Budget-Final-Budget.pdf)). They do not answer to anyone but themselves. I know this sounds extreme, but hear me out to the end.\n\nFirst, some background:\n\nThe group that governs the SFSS is made up of roughly 40 people, and is split up into executive and non-executive counselors. Executive counselors (7 students) are those who were elected by the entire SFU student body in the yearly election - this includes the president, and all the vice presidents of various departments (internal affairs, diversity and equity, etc.) The non-executive counselors (roughly 30 students) are representatives from various student societies and organizations. So for example, the biology student society has a rep. on the council, likewise Beedie has one, neurodiversity alliance, and etc.\n\nIn my view, the majority (80%) of counselors do absolutely nothing and are just there to pad resumes and collect a pay cheque (yes, they are paid). However, there is a group of \\~6 motivated individuals that love making the SFSS their personal piggy bank and political forum—they raise hell for anyone who disagrees.\n\nThe current president, Liam Feng, in my personal view, is a legitimately good guy. When he got elected, he tried—and unfortunately failed—to clean up the SFSS. Aiming to support students instead of wasting our money and time on mock UN politics or fully-funded student trips to Ottawa.\n\nEarlier this month, he proposed a motion to get rid of all politically-charged issues policies (IPs) at the SFSS. His argument was that the student society should represent the **entire** student body, and should not take stances on abolishing Canadian police or wars in the Middle East; this is not a good use of time for council, nor should it be part of the SFSS, as the society is supposed to support **all** students on campus. These policies are divisive and the SFSS has gotten themselves into deep shit for them in the past, as it’s been argued that the policies discriminate against groups of students that disagree with them.\n\nThe meeting on the day of the vote went as follows: his motion was thrown out, he (and anyone in support of him) were verbally abused by about 20 woke keyboard warriors for over an hour (most of whom I don’t think were undergrad SFU students, so not even part of the SFSS membership, but were brought in by someone on council) in the call. Calls for his impeachment, **censure**, etc. were widespread in the chat. Then there was a motion created (and passed) within **20 minutes** with the goal of limiting his power. They opened an investigation into him personally for his actions of trying to take politics out of the SFSS.\n\nHere is the scary part—this entire thing was orchestrated by a group of maybe 4 councilors? out of the entire council? Saying this as a former counselor—the majority of counselors seemed to be either asleep or scared to say anything during this entire debacle. Honestly, I was shocked at the treatment of Liam and those who supported him.\n\nAfter this, as additional retaliation for Liam’s proposed motion, the same group of 4 created (and passed) another motion that stated that any changes to the political motions (IPs) must first pass through and be recommended by the diversity and equity committee of the SFSS. This sets a very dangerous precedent, in that you can very easily have a motion proposed by someone that won’t even make it to the general voting stage unless it’s agreed upon by a small group of people.\n\n**This is no longer a democracy.**\n\nFor example - say I wanted to propose a “free coffee” day motion for all students. If someone who sat on the necessary committee that is to be consulted had a vendetta against me personally, my motion could be vetoed before it even makes it to the general voting stage. While currently this has only been passed in matters relating to politics (IPs), it is very easy to extend this to all matters at the university.\n\n**This part is very important. With this precedent, you no longer have a democracy.**\n\nThe 20% of council members pushing their (often extreme) ideas, combined with 80% of the counselors that are indifferent to most things, means that things like this routinely pass without a hitch. Motions are often created the day of, or even during council meetings, which means most **SFU students don’t even know about them**, much less have an opportunity to be consulted. I can clearly see a situation of ridiculously simple fraud, committed by a motivated council member with no repercussions at all—as seen in the past exec teams. This is in addition to the **huge** number of cases from the past when regular students raised concerns of the SFSS and got blown off or ignored.\n\n(As an aside, my issue isn't with opposing Liam’s motion and wanting to speak about it, people are entitled to whatever opinion they want to have. However, many (most) of those speaking against Liam   \n\\- a few SFSS councilors and many others in the zoom meeting - weren’t able to have an adult discussion on a controversial subject, acting like 3 year olds having temper tantrums, and starting an (IMO, bs) official investigation against him. Needless to say, this doesn't reflect well on the school.)\n\nWhy does this matter to you?\n\n**I understand that many of you couldn’t care less about the actions of the SFSS.** **You've got enough going on with actually being a student and all.**\n\nHowever - not only are our student fees (\\~$500-600 per student over a 4yr degree) funding this shit-show, but if the SFSS decides to start a civil war with SFU admin (like almost happened with the SUB closure a couple years ago) or pass more lovely extreme political motions, this can **and will** affect the reputation of our school and your university degree.\n\nTake a look at what happened at Harvard, UPenn, and MIT at a recent US Congressional hearing in December, when these universities were brought before the congress regarding (mis)treatment of minority (Jewish) students on campus, largely caused by action or inaction of their student unions (who had taken similar policies and stances to those taken by the SFSS.)\n\nThere were huge, long lasting effects from this hearing. There are now entire companies—Barstool Sports for example—that refuse to hire graduates from these schools. Professors have left these universities. Donors are cancelling multi-million dollar donations. These are far from the only cases, and it's happening locally in Vancouver and Canada too.\n\n[Canadian universities face lawsuits claiming antisemitism | CTV News](https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/multiple-canadian-universities-facing-class-action-lawsuit-claiming-antisemitism-1.6720906)\n\n**The exact same thing can happen at SFU.**\n\nDonors have been speaking out against the school directly due to actions taken by the SFSS. The issues go far beyond just the alleged discrimination against minorities (or otherwise groups they don't like) as linked above. They have to do with a shocking lack of financial and political transparency in the SFSS, and having absolutely no room for opposing thoughts or conversations (as used to be a foundational point of higher education.)\n\nAs donations dry up, SFU’s bottom line takes a hit - our campus facilities, professorships, scholarships, bursaries, and more can and will be affected. Things are only going to get worse from here on. Not to mention the already ridiculous running costs of the organization.\n\n[Still our money: The SFSS is spending too much running itself (the-peak.ca)](https://the-peak.ca/2022/08/still-our-money-the-sfss-is-spending-too-much-running-itself/)\n\nAt this point I don’t see a way to fix this short of overhauling the entire organization and hiring qualified individuals with the necessary life experience, and a board to oversee the goings-on of the SFSS. Cause remember, they don’t answer to anyone.\n\nGoodluck, future SFU students. The baton is in your hands. When things start to go to shit, don't say I didn't warn you.",1706579649.0

Here is some background on me: I love stats and accounting, and i like math. Throughout this year I've been debating whether to go study business and go to a good school in Ontario (UofT, Queens, Western) or whether to stay home, and study actuarial science at SFU, and probably get an MBA after a couple years?\n\n1. **Am I in actuarial science, or just general science?** i see posts talking about how competitive it is to get act sci as a major, but this was years ago. So I'm assuming its changed and I'm in act sci direct out of high school?\n2. **Do most people become actuaries?** I am not so sure about actually being an actuary, but i do love SFUs course layout for the program, plenty of accounting and finance, and math that interests me alot. I really want to work in finance, and I'm wondering whether its semi-common for actuary science students at SFU to pursue this. To me it would make sense, as they have alot of the technical knowledge that Beedie kids have, with a more quantitative background.\n3. **What is the level of students?** I am either aiming for a top business program because I would  do well there. Or a somewhat local/small actuary science program with less competitive/keener students. I mean I don't want to study at waterloo/Uoft act sci because of this. I am kind of below average for a mathy major (I think), I don't know if this helps but here are my marks for relevant courses: Financial accounting-97 Precalculus-90 Ap stats-96 Physics-86. What I am trying to say is that most kids studying math would probably get a high 90 in precalc, but with lots of effort i only got 90. But I love stats and math and I don't want to just let go of the effort I've put into these subjects.\n4. **Is this right for me?**  If you've read through all this I really appreciate it, and from what you've read does this seem like its the right fit for me? My number 1 choice right now is Statistics with Ivey aeo at Western, and this because its a smaller stats program, and Canadas top finance program, its perfect for me, but its really competitive and I need to understand my other opportunities. Again I would love to go to queens/Uoft and do business with a minor in stats, but I might not get in, and I know i do not want to go to a ""tier 2"" business program, Id want to study actuarial science, maybe at SFU.\n\nAgain if anyone has read though this, I appreciate it alot, I have lots of anxiety when it comes to my future and its nice to know people take time out of their day to help out.\n\nSide note: it comes across that act sci is a backup for me, but with my current grades my chance's for tier 1 business programs are kind of low, and I am starting to like the idea of actuary science more day by day. To be specific I only have three programs above SFU act sci.",1706420550.0
